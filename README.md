# 🏎️ PitstopStrategy
To simulate and compare different Formula 1 pit stop strategies using real race data, and estimate how tyre degradation affects lap times and total race time.

---

## Features

- Visualizes tyre degradation over laps
- Compares different pitstop strategies (e.g., 1-stop vs 2-stop)
- Predicts lap times using regression models (Random Forest)
- Plotly interactive graphs
- Integrated with FastF1 API to fetch real telemetry and lap data

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: FastF1, Plotly, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Models Used**: Random Forest Regressor (for lap time prediction)
